I'm Thanh Le ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer living in the Sweden, working as a senior software engineer at [The Techno Creatives](https://technocreatives.com).

I'm a contributor of [Lichess](https://lichess.org/) and a maintainer of it's chess logic library [scalachess](https://github.com/lichess-org/scalachess).

I love functional programming because it's a lot of fun to use and you end up with a robust and maintainable software.

I like contributing to OSS, reading, working out and playing chess.
