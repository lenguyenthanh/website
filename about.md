I'm Thanh, a passionate software engineer with strong architecture skills and the ability to learn quickly. I work as a senior software engineer at [The Techno Creatives](https://technocreatives.com). I love programming, open source, working out and playing chess.


### Software

I love functional programming language because it's a lot of fun to learn, write and you end up with a robust and maintainable software.
