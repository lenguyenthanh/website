I'm Thanh Le ðŸ‘‹

I live in the Sweden, working as a software engineer at [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com) (previously [The Techno Creatives](https://technocreatives.com)).

I'm a member of [Lichess](https://github.com/lichess-org) team - the open-source, adless, and worldwide second-biggest chess website in the world.

I love [functional programming](/tags/functional programming.html), especially [Scala](/tags/scala.html) because it gives me a lot of fun and trust, while having the side effect of creating robust and maintainable software.

I like contributing to open sources, reading, working out and playing chess.
