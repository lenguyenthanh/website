I'm Thanh Le ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer living in the Sweden, working as a software engineer at [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com) (previously [The Techno Creatives](https://technocreatives.com)).

I'm a member of [Lichess](https://lichess.org/) team and a maintainer of it's chess library [scalachess](https://github.com/lichess-org/scalachess).

I love functional programming because it's a lot of fun to use and you end up with a robust and maintainable software.

I like contributing to open sources, reading, working out and playing chess.
