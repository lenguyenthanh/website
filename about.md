I'm Thanh Le ðŸ‘‹

I work as a senior software engineer at [The Techno Creatives](https://technocreatives.com).

I love functional programming language because it's a lot of fun to learn/write and you end up with a robust and maintainable software.

I also like open source, reading, working out and playing chess.
